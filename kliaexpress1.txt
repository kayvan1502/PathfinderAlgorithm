The KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit train services have start operating again, but will introduce a limited service schedule for a month.

Starting May 4, trains will run every 20 minutes during peak hours on weekdays, and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours, weekends and national public holidays.

“The schedule will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary to suit the growing passenger ridership. A new schedule will be published five days prior to implementation, after consultation with and approval from the relevant authorities,” said Express Rail Link (ERL) in a statement posted on its website.

Both KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit will run as a combined service. There will be no train services before 6am and after the last train departure at 11pm.

During this period, passengers need to follow social distancing and other safety measures to curb Covid-19. These include body temperature check, wearing masks and cashless payment.

"Any passenger whose body temperature is 37.5⁰C or higher will be denied entry. In addition, all passengers are strongly advised to wear a mask at all times when using the train service,” said ERL.

Passengers are also urged to keep a safe distance of at least 1m apart at all times, including on the platform and onboard the train.

Additionally, passengers are encouraged to avoid paying by cash and instead go cashless when buying their tickets.

"They can use contactless cards or Touch ‘n Go directly at the gate or pay with their preferred e-wallet at the counter,” said ERL, adding that standard tickets can be bought at the self-service kiosk.

The journey time between KL Sentral and KLIA will be 35 minutes (KLIA2: 39 minutes). At KL Sentral, all departures and arrivals will be through the KLIA Transit Station.
