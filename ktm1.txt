Covid-19: KTM reducing frequency of trains during MCO
Nation  
Sunday, 22 Mar 2020

12:03 AM MYT
PETALING JAYA: Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd (KTM) will be reducing the frequency of train services for the duration of the movement control order (MCO).

According to KTM chief executive officer Datuk Kamarulzaman Zainal, its Electric Train Services (ETS), KTM Komuter, Skypark Link and Intercity train services will be affected.

Kamarulzaman said there would be a reduction of daily trips – the ETS with eight compared to 40 daily trips, the KTM Intercity will see a reduction to 10 trips from 18, while the KTM Komuter will be reduced from 208 to 164 daily trips.

"Commuter operations on weekdays will also be reduced to 138 compared to 167 daily trips.

"The Tebrau Shuttle, which operates between the Johor Bahru Sentral station and Woodlands Station (in Singapore), will be reduced to eight trips a day compared to 31 before," Kamarulzaman said a press release on late Saturday (March 21).

Kamarulzaman also said that the Skypark Link train between the KL Sentral Station and the Subang airport would be reduced to eight trips a day compared to 32 before.

According to Kamarulzaman, the reduction in the number of trips was done to comply with the government's directive to reduce interstate travel.

"It also takes into account the drastic drop in passengers," he said.

Meanwhile, Kamarulzaman said passengers can make amendments or cancel their tickets at the counter or through its official website www.ktmb.com.my.

He also urged the public to obtain the latest information regarding train operations by KTM's official website or to call its hotline at 0322671200.

The two-week MCO imposed by the government began on March 18 will end on March 31.
